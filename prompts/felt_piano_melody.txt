Create an 16-bar melodic loop in A minor scale.
Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel
Description of the vibe:
Dark, haunting, and hypnotic. The melody should be sparse but impactful, with occasional dissonant touches to enhance the dark atmosphere.
The melody should capture the unknown and poteical aspects of life to match the game of life algorithm rvoluition
Music Characteristics:

Key: A minor harmonic (A, B, C, D, E, F, G#)
Tempo: 90 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Length: 16 bars

Melodic Guidelines:

Use only notes from the A minor scale.
Use repetitive patterns with subtle variations.
Include moments of silence for breath and tension.

Rules:

Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 95 BPM).
Use note names (e.g., A4, C#5).
Use MIDI channel 0 for the melody.
Ensure the loop is exactly 8 bars long (32 beats).
Vary the velocity (50-120) to add dynamics and emotion.
Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Example (2 bars, just for notation and not creative purpose):
0 A4 0.5 100 0
1 C5 0.25 90 0
1.5 E5 0.25 95 0
2 G#4 1 110 0
4 F5 0.5 85 0
4.75 D5 0.25 80 0
5.5 B4 0.5 90 0
6.5 A4 0.5 100 0
7 C5 0.5 95 0
7.5 E5 0.5 100 0
Now, generate an 16-bar felt piano melody loop following these guidelines precisely. Remember to only output the MIDI note data without any additional text or explanations.
