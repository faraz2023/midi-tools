Create an 8-bar dark melodic techno bassline loop in A minor harmonic scale.

Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel

Description of the vibe:
Deep, pulsating, and ominous. The bassline should provide a solid foundation with occasional surprises to maintain interest.

Music Characteristics:
1. Key: A minor harmonic (A, B, C, D, E, F, G#)
2. Tempo: 95 BPM
3. Time Signature: 4/4
4. Length: 8 bars

Bassline Guidelines:
1. Focus on the root (A), fifth (E), and raised seventh (G#) for a strong harmonic minor feel.
2. Use primarily notes in the range of A1 to A3.
3. Create a driving, rhythmic pattern with some syncopation.
4. Include occasional slides or pitch bends for added tension.
5. Use longer notes (half notes, whole notes) sparingly for contrast.
6. Incorporate subtle rhythmic variations every 2 or 4 bars.

Rules:
1. Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 95 BPM).
2. Use note names (e.g., A2, E2).
3. Use MIDI channel 0 for the bassline.
4. Ensure the loop is exactly 8 bars long (32 beats).
5. Vary the velocity (70-110) to add groove and movement.
6. Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
7. Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Example (2 bars):
0 A2 0.5 100 0
0.75 E2 0.25 90 0
1 A2 0.5 95 0
1.75 C3 0.25 85 0
2 E2 0.5 100 0
2.5 G#2 0.5 110 0
3 A2 0.75 95 0
4 A2 0.5 100 0
4.75 E2 0.25 90 0
5 A2 0.5 95 0
5.75 D3 0.25 85 0
6 E2 0.5 100 0
6.5 F2 0.5 90 0
7 G#2 1 105 0

Now, generate an 8-bar dark melodic techno bassline loop following these guidelines precisely. Remember to only output the MIDI note data without any additional text or explanations.
