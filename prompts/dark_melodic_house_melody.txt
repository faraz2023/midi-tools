Create an 8-bar dark melodic techno melody loop in A minor harmonic scale.
Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel
Description of the vibe:
Dark, haunting, and hypnotic. The melody should be sparse but impactful, with occasional dissonant touches to enhance the dark atmosphere.
Music Characteristics:

Key: A minor harmonic (A, B, C, D, E, F, G#)
Tempo: 95 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Length: 8 bars

Melodic Guidelines:

Use primarily notes from the A minor harmonic scale.
Incorporate occasional chromatic notes for tension.
Focus on the mid to high register (A4 to A6).
Use repetitive patterns with subtle variations.
Include moments of silence for breath and tension.
Emphasize the raised 7th (G#) for the harmonic minor flavor.

Rules:

Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 95 BPM).
Use note names (e.g., A4, C#5).
Use MIDI channel 0 for the melody.
Ensure the loop is exactly 8 bars long (32 beats).
Vary the velocity (50-120) to add dynamics and emotion.
Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Example (2 bars):
0 A4 0.5 100 0
1 C5 0.25 90 0
1.5 E5 0.25 95 0
2 G#4 1 110 0
4 F5 0.5 85 0
4.75 D5 0.25 80 0
5.5 B4 0.5 90 0
6.5 A4 0.5 100 0
7 C5 0.5 95 0
7.5 E5 0.5 100 0
Now, generate an 8-bar dark melodic techno melody loop following these guidelines precisely. Remember to only output the MIDI note data without any additional text or explanations.
