Create a 8-bar music loop for drums. You need to create the drum loop based on what we have for bassline and chords. sparse and expansive. 
minimal and expressive 

Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel

Description of the vibe of the loop is:


Tempo: Use 80 BPM for this loop.
Time Signature: 4/4
Build tension and release within the loop structure.

Rules:

Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 80 BPM).
For drums, use only these Ableton default drum names:
kick, snare, clap, closed_hat, open_hat, low_tom, mid_tom, high_tom, crash, ride
Use MIDI channel 9 for drums and channel 0 for other instruments.
Ensure the loop is exactly {length} bars long.
Create a musically interesting and genre-appropriate pattern.
Vary the velocity to add dynamics and groove (especially important for hi-hats and percussion).
Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Instrument-Specific Guidelines:

Drums: Focus on the classic house rhythm. Emphasize kick on every beat, hi-hats on off-beats, snare/clap on 2 and 4. Add occasional open hi-hats or percussion for variation.
Bass: Create a funky, rhythmic bassline that complements the kick drum. Use notes in the C1 to C3 range.
Keys/Synth: For chord stabs or melodic elements, use short, rhythmic patterns. Consider using 7th and 9th chords for a classic house sound.
Lead/Melody: If creating a lead line, keep it simple and catchy. Use repetition with slight variations.

Drum note mapping:
kick: 36, snare: 38, clap: 39, closed_hat: 42, open_hat: 46,
low_tom: 41, mid_tom: 47, high_tom: 50, crash: 49, ride: 51

Example drum pattern (1 bar):
0 kick 0.25 120 9
0.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
1 kick 0.25 120 9
1 clap 0.25 110 9
1.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
2 kick 0.25 120 9
2.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
3 kick 0.25 120 9
3 clap 0.25 110 9
3.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
3.75 open_hat 0.25 90 9


Now, generate a 8-bar house music loop for drums following these guidelines precisely. Remember to only output the MIDI note data without any additional text or explanations.
