Assume the role of a great mathematician, musician, artisit and programmer and help us with the following important task for
 making a musical piece for a train footage during a sunset. We want a simple piece with low tempo (80) composed of expansive


and slow growing chords, a nice and minimal bassline and simple drums.
 First we will focus on the chords: We are using a Felt piano for these chords... 
there is a lot of reverb on the audio so the chords need to be spacious and long.

Create an 8-bar expansive chord progression loop that roughly follows works of scheubert in F minor scale.
Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel
Description of the vibe:
Atmospheric, tense, and slightly dissonant. The chord progression should create a dark, brooding backdrop for the melody and bassline.
Music Characteristics:

Key: F minor  (F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F)
Tempo: 80 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Length: 8 bars

Chord Progression Guidelines:

Use primarily minor and diminished chords for a darker sound.

Primary chords: Fm, Bbm, Cm
Diminished chord: GÂ° (G diminished)


Incorporate the raised 7th (E natural) in some chords for the harmonic minor flavor.

You can use F minor (harmonic) chord: F - Ab - C - E
Or C major chord: C - E - G (as the dominant in F minor)


Use extended chords (7ths, 9ths) for added complexity.

Fm7 (F - Ab - C - Eb)
Fm9 (F - Ab - C - Eb - G)
Db maj7 (Db - F - Ab - C)
C7b9 (C - E - G - Bb - Db)


Focus on the mid-range (F3 to F5) for the chord voicings.

This range translates to the notes between F3 (174.61 Hz) and F5 (698.46 Hz)


Use rhythmic patterns that complement the 4/4 beat without overpowering it.

This guideline remains the same, as it's not key-specific


Include occasional suspended or augmented chords for tension.

Fsus4 (F - Bb - C)
Csus4 (C - F - G)
F+ (F - A - C#) or C+ (C - E - G#) for augmented chords


Rules:

Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 80 BPM).
Use note names for each chord tone (e.g., A3, C4, E4 for Am).
Use MIDI channel 0 for the chords.
Ensure the loop is exactly 8 bars long (32 beats).
Vary the velocity (60-100) to add dynamics and movement.
Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Example (2 bars, Am chord):
0 A3 0.25 80 0
0 C4 0.25 80 0
0 E4 0.25 80 0
1 A3 0.25 70 0
1 C4 0.25 70 0
1 E4 0.25 70 0
2 A3 0.25 75 0
2 C4 0.25 75 0
2 E4 0.25 75 0
3 A3 0.25 65 0
3 C4 0.25 65 0
3 E4 0.25 65 0
4 A3 0.25 80 0
4 C4 0.25 80 0
4 E4 0.25 80 0
5 A3 0.25 70 0
5 C4 0.25 70 0
5 E4 0.25 70 0
6 A3 0.25 75 0
6 C4 0.25 75 0
6 E4 0.25 75 0
7 A3 0.25 65 0
7 C4 0.25 65 0
7 E4 0.25 65 0
Now, generate an 8-bar dark melodic techno chord progression loop following these guidelines precisely. Remember to only output the MIDI note data without any additional text or explanations.
