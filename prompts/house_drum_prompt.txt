Create a 4-bar house music loop for drums
Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel

Description of the vibe of the loop is:
Buttery and soul like 

House Music Characteristics:

Tempo: Typically 120-130 BPM. Use 95 BPM for this loop.
Time Signature: 4/4
Key Elements: Steady kick drum on every beat, off-beat hi-hats, snare or clap on beats 2 and 4.
Groove: Emphasize the "four-on-the-floor" beat with syncopated elements.
Bassline: If applicable, create a rhythmic, often syncopated bassline.
Chord Stabs: For melodic instruments, consider adding short, rhythmic chord stabs.
Build tension and release within the loop structure.

Rules:

Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 95 BPM).
For drums, use only these Ableton default drum names:
kick, snare, clap, closed_hat, open_hat, low_tom, mid_tom, high_tom, crash, ride
For melodic instruments, use note names (e.g., C4, F#5).
Use MIDI channel 9 for drums and channel 0 for other instruments.
Ensure the loop is exactly {length} bars long.
Create a musically interesting and genre-appropriate pattern.
Vary the velocity to add dynamics and groove (especially important for hi-hats and percussion).
Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Instrument-Specific Guidelines:

Drums: Focus on the classic house rhythm. Emphasize kick on every beat, hi-hats on off-beats, snare/clap on 2 and 4. Add occasional open hi-hats or percussion for variation.
Bass: Create a funky, rhythmic bassline that complements the kick drum. Use notes in the C1 to C3 range.
Keys/Synth: For chord stabs or melodic elements, use short, rhythmic patterns. Consider using 7th and 9th chords for a classic house sound.
Lead/Melody: If creating a lead line, keep it simple and catchy. Use repetition with slight variations.

Drum note mapping:
kick: 36, snare: 38, clap: 39, closed_hat: 42, open_hat: 46,
low_tom: 41, mid_tom: 47, high_tom: 50, crash: 49, ride: 51
Example house drum pattern (1 bar):
0 kick 0.25 120 9
0.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
1 kick 0.25 120 9
1 clap 0.25 110 9
1.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
2 kick 0.25 120 9
2.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
3 kick 0.25 120 9
3 clap 0.25 110 9
3.5 closed_hat 0.25 100 9
3.75 open_hat 0.25 90 9
Example house bassline (1 bar):
0 C2 0.25 100 0
0.5 C2 0.25 90 0
1 G1 0.25 100 0
1.5 C2 0.25 90 0
2 E2 0.25 100 0
2.5 C2 0.25 90 0
3 G1 0.25 100 0
3.5 C2 0.25 90 0


Now, generate a 4-bar house music loop for drums following these guidelines precisely. Remember to only output the MIDI note data without any additional text or explanations.
