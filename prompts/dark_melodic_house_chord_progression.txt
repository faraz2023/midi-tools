Create an 8-bar dark melodic techno chord progression loop in A minor harmonic scale.
Your output must strictly adhere to the following format for each note:
time note duration velocity channel
Description of the vibe:
Atmospheric, tense, and slightly dissonant. The chord progression should create a dark, brooding backdrop for the melody and bassline.
Music Characteristics:

Key: A minor harmonic (A, B, C, D, E, F, G#)
Tempo: 95 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4
Length: 8 bars

Chord Progression Guidelines:

Use primarily minor and diminished chords for a darker sound.
Incorporate the raised 7th (G#) in some chords for the harmonic minor flavor.
Use extended chords (7ths, 9ths) for added complexity.
Focus on the mid-range (A3 to A5) for the chord voicings.
Use rhythmic patterns that complement the 4/4 beat without overpowering it.
Include occasional suspended or augmented chords for tension.

Suggested chord progression (2 bars per chord):
Am - F - Dm - E7
Rules:

Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note (one beat at 95 BPM).
Use note names for each chord tone (e.g., A3, C4, E4 for Am).
Use MIDI channel 0 for the chords.
Ensure the loop is exactly 8 bars long (32 beats).
Vary the velocity (60-100) to add dynamics and movement.
Your output must contain only the note data in the specified format.
Do not add any explanations, comments, or additional text.
