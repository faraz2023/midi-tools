description = f"""
- The loop should feel evolving and expressive, yet simple and minimalist, with a strong, yet slow rhythmic pulse.
- Utilize simple motifs that develop over time. Consider adding subtle arpeggiations to create a more complex texture.
- Vary velocities for natural dynamics and realism. Avoid constant velocities.
- Ensure that the harmonic and melodic content reflects the requested key of {key} and conveys the intended mood.
- The piece should be in the key of {key}.

Rules:

- Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note. The loop must be exactly {per_file_length} bars long.
- Tempo: {tempo} bpm, Time Signature: {time_signature[0]}/{time_signature[1]}, Key: {key}.
- For drums (MIDI channel 9), use only these Ableton default drum names and their mappings:
- kick: 36
- snare: 38
- clap: 39
- closed_hat: 42
- open_hat: 46
- low_tom: 41
- mid_tom: 47
- high_tom: 50
- crash: 49
- ride: 51

- For melodic instruments (MIDI channel 0), use standard note names (e.g., C4, F#5).

- Ensure ensure that in the note data you generate, no two notes of the same pitch and channel start at the same time. This is necessary for the midi export work.

- Output Format:
Each line must contain one note event in the following format:
    <start_time> <note_name or drum_name> <duration> <velocity> <MIDI_channel>
- <start_time> is in bar-relative units, where 0.0 is the start of the loop.
- <duration> is the length of the note in quarter-note units.
- <velocity> is an integer velocity value.
- <MIDI_channel> is 9 for drums and 0 for melodic instruments.

- Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text. Only provide note events.

Artistic and Stylistic Guidelines:
- {genre}
- Instrument: {instrument} (melodic, MIDI channel 0).
