Rules:

- Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note. The loop must be exactly {per_file_length} bars long.
- Tempo: {tempo} bpm, Time Signature: {time_signature[0]}/{time_signature[1]}, Key: {key}.
- For melodic instruments (MIDI channel 0), use standard note names (e.g., C4, F#5).

- Output Format:
Each line must contain one note event in the following format:
    <start_time> <note_name> <duration> <velocity> <MIDI_channel>
- <start_time> is in bar-relative units, where 0.0 is the start of the loop.
- <start_time> is in quarter-note units, where:
  - 0.0 = start of quarter note 1
  - 1.0 = start of quarter note 2
  - 2.0 = start of quarter note 3
  - 3.0 = start of quarter note 4
  - Subdivisions use decimals (0.5 = eighth note, 0.25 = sixteenth note)
- <duration> is the length of the note in quarter-note units:
  - 1.0 = quarter note
  - 0.5 = eighth note
  - 0.25 = sixteenth note
  - 0.125 = thirty-second note
- <velocity> is an integer velocity value.
- <MIDI_channel> is 0 for all notes (both melody and chords).
- <IMPORTANT> We must have {per_file_length} bars which with the above format results in {per_file_length*4} quarter notes.

- Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text. Only provide note events.
- Ensure that in the note data you generate, no two notes of the same pitch and channel start at the same time.
- The output should contain BOTH melody notes and chord notes, properly synchronized.
- Chords should support and enhance the melody, not overpower it.
- Melody notes should be in a higher register than chord notes for clarity.

Artistic and Stylistic Guidelines:
- {genre}
- Instrument: {instrument} (melodic, MIDI channel 0).

- Create a cohesive musical piece where melody and chords complement each other.
- The melody should be expressive and lyrical, while the chords provide harmonic support and movement.
- Melody notes should generally be in a higher register than chord notes for clarity.
- Use chord voicings that support but don't overpower the melody.
- Vary velocities naturally - typically melody notes slightly louder than chord notes.
- Ensure smooth voice leading in both melody and chord progressions.
- Consider using passing tones in the melody that create tension and resolution with the underlying chords.
- The harmonic rhythm (chord changes) should support the melodic phrases.
