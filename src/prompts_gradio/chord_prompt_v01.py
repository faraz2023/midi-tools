Rules:

- Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note. The loop must be exactly {per_file_length} bars long.
- Tempo: {tempo} bpm, Time Signature: {time_signature[0]}/{time_signature[1]}, Key: {key}.
- For melodic instruments (MIDI channel 0), use standard note names (e.g., C4, F#5).

- Output Format:
Each line must contain one note event in the following format:
    <start_time> <note_name> <duration> <velocity> <MIDI_channel>
- <start_time> is in bar-relative units, where 0.0 is the start of the loop.
- <start_time> is in quarter-note units, where:
  - 0.0 = start of quarter note 1
  - 1.0 = start of quarter note 2
  - 2.0 = start of quarter note 3
  - 3.0 = start of quarter note 4
  - Subdivisions use decimals (0.5 = eighth note, 0.25 = sixteenth note)
- <duration> is the length of the note in quarter-note units:
  - 1.0 = quarter note
  - 0.5 = eighth note
  - 0.25 = sixteenth note
  - 0.125 = thirty-second note
- <velocity> is an integer velocity value.
- <MIDI_channel> is 0 for melodic instruments.

- Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text. Only provide note events.

- Ensure ensure that in the note data you generate, no two notes of the same pitch and channel start at the same time. This is necessary for the midi export work.

Artistic and Stylistic Guidelines:
- {genre}
- Instrument: {instrument} (melodic, MIDI channel 0).

- The chord progression should be expressive and evolving, yet simple and minimalist.
- Utilize simple chord voicings that develop over time. Consider adding subtle inversions or extensions to create a more complex harmony.
- Vary velocities for natural dynamics and realism. Avoid constant velocities.
