Rules:

- IMPORTANT: The loop MUST be EXACTLY {per_file_length} bars long, no more and no less.
- Use absolute timing, where 1.0 represents a quarter note. The loop must be exactly {per_file_length} bars long.
- In {time_signature[0]}/{time_signature[1]} time, each bar is {time_signature[0]}.0 beats long.
- Tempo: {tempo} bpm, Time Signature: {time_signature[0]}/{time_signature[1]}, Key: {key}.
- For melodic instruments (MIDI channel 0), use standard note names (e.g., C4, F#5).

- Output Format:
Each line must contain one note event in the following format:
    <start_time> <note_name> <duration> <velocity> <MIDI_channel>
- <start_time> is in bar-relative units, where 0.0 is the start of the loop.
- <start_time> is in quarter-note units, where:
  - 0.0 = start of quarter note 1
  - 1.0 = start of quarter note 2
  - 2.0 = start of quarter note 3
  - 3.0 = start of quarter note 4
  - Subdivisions use decimals (0.5 = eighth note, 0.25 = sixteenth note)
- <duration> is the length of the note in quarter-note units:
  - 1.0 = quarter note
  - 0.5 = eighth note
  - 0.25 = sixteenth note
  - 0.125 = thirty-second note
- <velocity> is an integer velocity value.
- <MIDI_channel> is 0 for melodic instruments.
- <IMPORTANT> We must have {per_file_length} bars which with the above format results in {per_file_length*4} quarter notes.

- Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text. Only provide note events.
- Ensure ensure that in the note data you generate, no two notes of the same pitch and channel start at the same time.

Artistic and Stylistic Guidelines:
- {genre}
- Instrument: {instrument} (melodic, MIDI channel 0).
